First of all: this project is just meant to give me a playground for programming. I like to write code 
and have I fun trying new features or some "unusual" way of implementation. You are welcome to use this 
code (it's all MIT licensed) and you are also welcome to give me a hint when something does not work - 
but still: this code is not tested for production ... before you use it: test it.

By the way: this file and all documentation has been generated by [Sem.MdDocGenerator](#Sem.MdDocGenerator)
